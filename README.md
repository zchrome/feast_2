Pure SuperCollider thing for live Ambisonics.
Spatialises sounds based on angle and distance from a movable point in a Cartesian space.
Motion is controlled with a GUI, for live performance this was in turn controlled from a Behringer BCF2000.

Decoding is expected to be done in REAPER (with the IEM AllRA Decoder).

Don't even try running this; execution order of the different code blocks is very contrieved and it assumes a lot of very specific things with regards to hardware, speaker setup and decoding.

Sound files not included.

For 29 channels in Lilla Salen, Royal College of Music, 2023.
